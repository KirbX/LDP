**Long Distance Planning**

An application for people like me that have a lot of projects in mind, but never know which one to do.
Let's say you have 30min behind you, and you want to do a project. You stare at your computer like ".... Which project could I do" and that's it, you lost 30 minutes trying to figure which project shall be done first. 
With this app, you can add in the "Add" tab, projects with a priority. Then, in "Random" tab you push on "Faire un choix simplifi√©" that will give you an answer based on projects and priority you gave to the app (increase the chance for a project to appears by increasing its priority).
In the "View" tab, you can see all your project, and delete them once they are done :) 

Still in developpment...
